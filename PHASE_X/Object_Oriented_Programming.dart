    [Class]: raw-structure, template for defining data-members and member-methods [properties & functions]
    
    [Object]: entities who actually implement the behaviour of the Class.

    [inheritence]: technique allows to implement the abilites (properties/ methods) of Parent Class into Child Class.

    [abstraction]: technique allows to disclose only necessary info/ data without showing un-necessary details.
    // i.e., focuses on What is to be done! Instead of How is to be done?

    [encapsulation]: wrapping/ capsulating of data-members or properties into one component/ unit (class).
    - to prevent from any un-wanted external access.
